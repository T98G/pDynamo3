The Dynamo Force Field (DYFF)
-----------------------------

The Dynamo force field is derived from the Universal Force Field (UFF) of Rappe et al. (JACS, 1992).

Parameter values are copied from the original UFF paper together with additions for metal-organic frameworks by
Addicoat et al (JCTC 2014) and Coupry et al (JCTC 2016).

Some corrections were made to the parameters by looking at other implementations of UFF (e.g. openbabel).
